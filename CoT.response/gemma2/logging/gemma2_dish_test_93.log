INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: first_appeared
row 1: 1955

INFO:root:data cleaning objectives: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column contains accurate and concise year data relevant to calculating dish duration, but lacks the necessary 'last_appeared' date for complete analysis.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on acquiring or deriving the 'last_appeared' dates for each dish to enable calculation of their durations.

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

**Explanations:**

* **Accuracy:**  Unknown (We can't assess accuracy without 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' date information.)
* **Relevance:** True (The 'name' column is relevant to identifying dishes.)
* **Completeness:** Unknown (We don't have information about missing values in the 'name' column)
* **Conciseness:** False (There are inconsistencies in capitalization and formatting,  e.g., "BEEF PEPPER STEAK" vs. "Broiled Swordfish Steak Florida").

**Since not all dimensions can be assessed as True, and we have concerns about Conciseness, the Flag should be False.** 


To proceed with data cleaning, you would need to:

1. **Standardize:** Clean up capitalization and punctuation in dish names for consistency.
2. **Gather Date Information:** Obtain 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates for each dish to enable duration calculations. 
3. **Address Missing Data:**  Determine if there are any missing dish names and decide how to handle them (e.g., imputation or removal).

INFO:root:data cleaning objectives: ## Summarization:

The 'name' column suffers from inconsistent formatting and mixed content, hindering accurate identification of unique dishes for duration analysis.


## Data Cleaning Objective:

Standardize capitalization and punctuation in the 'name' column, and potentially split it into separate columns for dish name, preparation style, and side dishes to improve accuracy and conciseness. 

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root:#TASK III: generate mass_edit arguments: 

 You're absolutely right!  The inconsistent formatting of the "name" column makes it very difficult to accurately determine which dishes have been on the menu for the shortest duration. 

Here's a breakdown of why data cleaning is crucial in this scenario and how we can approach it:

**Problems with the Current Data:**

* **Inconsistent Capitalization:**  "Corned Beef...On Russian Rye Bread" vs. "Finnan Haddie or striped bass"
* **Mixed Content:** Dish names are combined with preparation styles ("Broiled," "Fried") and side dishes ( "...On Russian Rye Bread", "French Fried Potatoes").
* **Abbreviations and Slang:** "Rinderzunge" (likely German for ox tongue) might be unfamiliar to some.

**Data Cleaning Steps:**

1. **Standardize Capitalization:** Convert all dish names to title case (e.g., "Corned Beef on Russian Rye Bread"). This will make it easier to group similar dishes together.
2. **Split into Separate Columns:** Consider splitting the "name" column into:
   *  **Dish Name:** The core ingredient or dish (e.g., "Corned Beef," "Swordfish Steak").
   * **Preparation Style:** How the dish is cooked (e.g., "Broiled," "Fried," "Roast").
   * **Sides/Accompaniments:** Any additional items served with the dish (e.g., "Russian Rye Bread," "French Fried Potatoes").

3. **Address Abbreviations and Slang:**  Research unfamiliar terms and standardize them to common English names. For example, "Rinderzunge" could be replaced with "Ox Tongue."

**Example of Cleaned Data:**

| Dish Name | Preparation Style | Sides/Accompaniments |
|---|---|---|
| Corned Beef |  | Russian Rye Bread |
| Swordfish Steak | Broiled | French Fried Potatoes |
| Ox Tongue | Roast |  | 


**Benefits of Cleaning:**

* **Improved Accuracy:** Easier to identify unique dishes and track their appearances.
* **Better Analysis:** Enables more meaningful calculations of dish durations.
* **Enhanced Understandability:** Makes the data easier to interpret for humans and machines.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

 ```
False
```

**Target column:** name 

**Explanations:**

* **Accuracy:**  False (The "name" column contains a mix of dish names, descriptions, ingredients, and potentially even non-food items like cigars or drinks. This inconsistency makes it difficult to accurately identify dishes for date tracking.)
* **Relevance:** True (The "name" column is relevant as it would contain the names of the dishes.)
* **Completeness:** N/A (We don't have information about 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates to assess completeness in this context).
* **Conciseness:** False (The entries are not standardized. Some are fully capitalized, some use abbreviations, and descriptions vary greatly.) 


Since Accuracy and Conciseness are both False, the Flag should be returned as  `False`. The "name" column requires cleaning and standardization before it can be used for the objective of identifying dishes by their appearance duration.

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

INFO:root:data cleaning objectives: ## Summarization:

The 'name' column suffers from inconsistent capitalization, punctuation, and redundant dish representations, impacting its accuracy and conciseness.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

Standardize the 'name' column by converting all text to lowercase, removing unnecessary punctuation, and consolidating variations of similar dishes into a single consistent representation.

INFO:root:#TASK III: generate mass_edit arguments: 

 You're absolutely right!  Cleaning up the "name" column is crucial for accurate analysis. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach this data cleaning task and why it matters for your purpose:

**1. Lowercase Conversion:**

*   Convert all text in the "name" column to lowercase using Python's `.lower()` method. This ensures consistency and avoids treating variations like "Corned Beef" and "corned beef" as different dishes.

```python
df['name'] = df['name'].str.lower() 
```

**2. Punctuation Removal:**

*   Remove unnecessary punctuation marks (commas, periods, etc.) using Python's `.replace()` method or regular expressions. For example:

```python
df['name'] = df['name'].str.replace('[^\w\s]', '', regex=True) 
```

**3. Dish Consolidation:**

*   This is the trickiest part and might require some manual inspection and rule-based logic. Here are a few strategies:

    * **Keyword Matching:** Identify common keywords (e.g., "corned beef," "swordfish," "lamb") and group dishes based on these keywords.
    * **Fuzzy String Matching:** Use libraries like `fuzzywuzzy` to calculate similarity scores between dish names and merge those with high scores.

**Example:**

Let's say you have these entries:

*   "Corned Beef...On Russian Rye Bread"
*   "corned beef sandwich on rye"

After lowercase conversion and punctuation removal, they become:

*   "corned beef on russian rye bread"
*   "corned beef sandwich on rye"

You could then use keyword matching ("corned beef") to group them together.

**Why This Matters for Your Analysis:**

* **Accuracy:** Clean data ensures that you're accurately identifying unique dishes and their appearance dates.
* **Efficiency:**  Standardized names make it easier to filter, sort, and analyze the menu data.
* **Insights:** By cleaning the "name" column, you can gain more meaningful insights into which dishes have been on the menu for the shortest duration.

**Target column:** name

**Explanations:**


* **Accuracy:**  False (The data in the "name" column is inconsistent. Some entries are clearly dish names, while others seem to be descriptions that include ingredients and sides.)
* **Relevance:** True (The "name" column would be relevant for identifying dishes)
* **Completeness:** True (All rows have a value in the "name" column)
* **Conciseness:** False (Dish names are not standardized. There are variations in capitalization, punctuation, and abbreviations.) 

**Since Accuracy and Conciseness are False, the Flag should be returned as False.**  You would need to clean this data before attempting to analyze dish durations. This might involve:

* **Standardizing Dish Names:** Creating a consistent format for dish names (e.g., removing ingredient lists, descriptions, and special formatting).
* **Potentially Using External Data:** If you have a menu database or external reference, you could try matching names to get more standardized entries.

The "name" column suffers from inconsistent formatting (capitalization, punctuation) leading to potential inaccuracies and misinterpretations during dish name comparisons. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

Standardize the "name" column by converting all entries to lowercase and removing unnecessary punctuation to ensure accurate and consistent comparison of dish names.

INFO:root:#TASK III: generate mass_edit arguments: 

 You're absolutely right! Inconsistent formatting in the "name" column can definitely cause problems when trying to analyze which dishes have been on the menu for the shortest duration.  

Here's a breakdown of how you could clean the "name" column using Python and the pandas library:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming your data is in a CSV file named 'menu_data.csv'
df = pd.read_csv('menu_data.csv') 

# Convert names to lowercase
df['name'] = df['name'].str.lower()

# Remove punctuation (except for hyphens, which might be important for dish names)
df['name'] = df['name'].str.replace('[^a-z0-9\-]', '', regex=True) 

print(df[['name']].head()) # Print the first few rows to check the results
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Import pandas:** This line imports the pandas library, which is essential for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

2. **Read the CSV:**  `pd.read_csv('menu_data.csv')` reads your menu data from a CSV file (replace 'menu_data.csv' with the actual name of your file).

3. **Convert to Lowercase:** `df['name'] = df['name'].str.lower()` converts all characters in the "name" column to lowercase, making comparisons case-insensitive.

4. **Remove Punctuation (Except Hyphens):**
   - `df['name'] = df['name'].str.replace('[^a-z0-9\-]', '', regex=True)` uses a regular expression (`[^a-z0-9\-]`) to match any character that is *not* a lowercase letter (a-z), a digit (0-9), or a hyphen (-).
   - The `str.replace()` function then replaces these matched characters with an empty string (''), effectively removing them.

**Important Considerations:**


* **Hyphens:** We've kept hyphens because they often separate words in dish names (e.g., "beef-and-barley"). If you want to remove all punctuation, simply omit the hyphen from the regular expression.
* **Special Characters:**  If your menu data contains other special characters (like accents or umlauts), you might need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.

After running this code, your "name" column will be much cleaner and more suitable for comparing dish names and determining which ones have been on the menu for the shortest periods.

**Target Column:** name

**Explanations:** 

* **Accuracy:**  False (The column contains inconsistent data types - dish names mixed with descriptions and potential pricing information. Some entries are in all caps, others sentence case. This inconsistency makes it hard to reliably identify distinct dishes.)
* **Relevance:** True (The 'name' column is relevant to the objective of identifying dishes.)
* **Completeness:**  N/A (We cannot assess completeness without knowing if there are missing dish names.)
* **Conciseness:** False (Dish names are not standardized. There are variations in capitalization, punctuation, and abbreviations ("STUFFED" vs "stuffed").

**Conclusion:** Since Accuracy and Conciseness are False, the Flag should be returned as  `False`, indicating the need for data cleaning before proceeding with the analysis.

```

**Target column:** name
**Explanations:**
* **Accuracy:**  Potentially False (Dishes have various descriptions with punctuation and capitalization inconsistencies).
* **Relevance:** True (The 'name' column contains the dish names needed for the objective)
* **Completeness:** True (All rows appear to have a dish name)
* **Conciseness:** False (Dish descriptions vary in length and detail, potentially indicating inconsistent representation of the same dish). 


Since Accuracy and Conciseness are likely False, the overall Flag should be **False**,  indicating the need for data cleaning before proceeding.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

The "name" column suffers from inconsistency in detail level and capitalization, hindering accurate comparison and identification of dishes. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

Standardize the format of dish names in the "name" column by converting them to title case and consider extracting relevant details into separate columns to improve accuracy and conciseness. 

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root:#TASK III: generate mass_edit arguments: 

 You're absolutely right! The inconsistency in the dish names makes it difficult to analyze and compare them effectively.  

Here's a breakdown of why data cleaning is crucial in this scenario and how we can approach it:

**Problems with the Current Data:**

* **Inconsistent Capitalization:** "Broiled Swordfish Steak Florida" vs. "Sardine, Whole"
* **Varying Detail Levels:** "Roast Hot House Baby Lamb, Mint Sauce" vs. "Lobster, Full Order" 
* **Combined Ingredients/Preparations:**  "Baked-Stuffed Mt. Trout; From the Cold Glacier Waters of Colorado"

**Data Cleaning Steps:**

1. **Title Case Conversion:** Convert all dish names to title case (e.g., "Broiled Swordfish Steak Florida" becomes "Broiled Swordfish Steak Florida"). This will help standardize the format.

2. **Splitting Details:** Consider splitting dish names into separate columns:
   *  **Dish Name:** The core name of the dish (e.g., "Swordfish Steak")
   * **Preparation:** How the dish is prepared (e.g., "Broiled")
   * **Modifiers:** Additional details like origin, sauce, or sides (e.g., "Florida", "Mint Sauce")

3. **Standardizing Units:** Ensure consistent units for quantities (e.g., "Full Order" vs. a specific weight).

**Example Transformation:**

| Original Dish Name                                       | Cleaned Dish Name | Preparation | Modifier           |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| BROILED SWORDFISH STEAK FLORIDA                         | Swordfish Steak   | Broiled     | Florida             |
| ROAST HOT HOUSE BABY LAMB, MINT SAUCE                  | Roast Lamb        | Roasted     | Mint Sauce          |
| LOBSTER, FULL ORDER                                     | Lobster           | -           | Full Order          |

**Benefits of Data Cleaning:**

* **Improved Accuracy:** More precise comparisons and analysis.
* **Easier Analysis:**  Ability to filter and group dishes by type, preparation, etc.
* **Better Insights:** Uncover patterns and trends in menu offerings over time.

**Target column:** name 

**Explanations:**

* **Accuracy:**  True (The entries appear to be dish names with consistent capitalization)
* **Relevance:** False (The 'name' column only contains the names of dishes. There is no information about when they appeared or disappeared from the menu.)
* **Completeness:** N/A (Completeness refers to missing values, and we don't have that information in this context)
* **Conciseness:** True (Dish names appear to be unique and consistently formatted).

**Since Relevance is False, not all dimensions are True, and we return False.**

INFO:root:#TASK III: generate mass_edit arguments: 

 You're on the right track!  Cleaning and standardizing the "name" column is crucial for accurately identifying dishes with the shortest durations. Here's a breakdown of why your approach is good and some additional considerations:

**Why Your Approach is Good:**

* **Consistent Case:** Converting to sentence case (e.g., "Roast Hot House Baby Lamb, Mint Sauce") will make comparisons easier and prevent issues arising from variations like "roast hot house baby lamb" vs. "Roast Hot House Baby Lamb".
* **Removing Punctuation:**  Getting rid of unnecessary punctuation like commas, periods, and extra spaces will simplify the text and help matching algorithms work more effectively.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Handling Variations:** Even with standardization, there might be subtle variations in dish names (e.g., "Roast Beef" vs. "Roasted Beef"). You might need to employ techniques like fuzzy string matching or stemming to account for these differences.
* **Contextual Clues:**  Sometimes the surrounding information (like row numbers or other menu items) can provide clues about whether two seemingly different dishes are actually variations of the same thing.

**Example Cleaning Steps (Python):**

```python
import re

def clean_dish_name(name):
    name = name.strip()  # Remove leading/trailing whitespace
    name = name.title() # Convert to sentence case
    name = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', name) # Remove punctuation 
    return name

# Example usage:
dirty_name = "Roast Hot House Baby Lamb, Mint Sauce"
cleaned_name = clean_dish_name(dirty_name)
print(cleaned_name)  # Output: Roast Hot House Baby Lamb Mint Sauce
```

* **Completeness:** N/A (We don't have information about 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates to assess completeness in relation to the objective)
* **Conciseness:**  Potentially False (Dish names have varying levels of detail and punctuation, which could lead to inconsistencies. For example, "STEAMED CLAMS" vs "STEAMED CLAMS, DRAWN BUTTER, PICKLED CABBAGE, SALTINES, CLAM BROTH").

**Since Accuracy and Conciseness are potentially False, the Flag should be returned as False.**  

**Additional Notes:** To accurately determine the duration of dishes on the menu, you would need additional columns like 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared'. This data cleaning pipeline should focus on standardizing the dish names for easier comparison, possibly extracting key ingredients or categories. 

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814

row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root:#TASK III: generate mass_edit arguments: 

 You're on the right track!  Cleaning and standardizing the dish names is crucial for accurately determining which dishes have been on the menu for the shortest duration. Here's a breakdown of why your approach is good and some additional considerations:

**Why Your Approach Is Good:**

* **Focus on Data Quality:** Recognizing that the "name" column needs cleaning is essential for meaningful analysis. Dirty data can lead to inaccurate conclusions.
* **Identifying Specific Issues:** You've pinpointed key problems like inconsistent capitalization, punctuation, and specificity (e.g., "Roast Beef" vs. "Boiled Fresh Brisket of Beef").

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Creating a Standardized Format:**  Decide on a consistent format for dish names. For example:
    * **Capitalization:** Title case (e.g., "Roast Hot House Baby Lamb")
    * **Punctuation:** Remove unnecessary punctuation or use it consistently (e.g., "Sardine, Whole" could become "Sardine Whole").
    * **Specificity:** Consider adding detail where needed to distinguish dishes (e.g., "Roast Beef" might become "Roast Beef with Horseradish Sauce").

* **Handling Synonyms and Variations:**  Dishes may have multiple names or slight variations. Develop a strategy for handling these:
    * **Merging:** Combine similar dishes under a single name (e.g., "Roast Lamb" and "Roasted Baby Lamb" could be merged).
    * **Creating Categories:** Group dishes into broader categories (e.g., "Beef Dishes," "Seafood").

* **Using Tools:** Text processing libraries in Python (like `nltk` or `spaCy`) can help automate some of the cleaning tasks, such as converting to title case and removing punctuation.



**Example Cleaning Steps:**

1. **Convert to Lowercase:**  Start by converting all dish names to lowercase.
2. **Title Case Conversion:** Apply title case conversion to each name.
3. **Remove Unnecessary Punctuation:** Remove commas, periods, etc., unless they are essential for distinguishing dishes.
4. **Standardize Descriptions:** Decide on a consistent level of detail in descriptions (e.g., always include sauce names).

**Remember:** The goal is to create clean, consistent dish names that allow you to accurately group and compare them based on their appearance dates.

False
```

**Target column:** name 

**Explanations:**


* **Accuracy:**  True (The entries seem to be dish names, but there are inconsistencies in capitalization and formatting.)
* **Relevance:** True (The 'name' column is relevant to identifying dishes on the menu)
* **Completeness:** N/A (We don't have information about 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates to assess completeness regarding dish durations.)
* **Conciseness:** False (There are variations in how dishes are described, e.g., "BEEF PEPPER STEAK" vs "STEAMED CLAMS," which might make it hard to consistently identify the same dish.)

**Since Conciseness is False, and not all dimensions are True, we return `False`. ** 

To proceed with the analysis, you'd need to:

1. **Standardize Dish Names:** Create a consistent naming convention for dishes.
2. **Add Date Information:** Introduce 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' columns for each dish.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the shortest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: name
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The "name" column, while relevant for identifying dishes, suffers from accuracy issues due to the inability to determine dish duration solely from the name and conciseness issues stemming from inconsistent formatting and capitalization.


## Data Cleaning Objective:

Standardize dish names by addressing inconsistencies in capitalization, punctuation, and specificity to improve data conciseness and enable more reliable grouping and comparison of dishes.

**Target column:**  name 

**Explanations:**

* **Accuracy:** True (The data appears to be accurately representing dish names.)
* **Relevance:** False (The 'name' column doesn't provide information about when dishes were first or last served on the menu. You would need additional columns like 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' for this objective.)
* **Completeness:**  N/A (While there are dish names, we lack the necessary date information to assess completeness regarding the objective) 
* **Conciseness:** True (Dish names appear standardized. )

Since Relevance is False, the overall Flag must be returned as **False**. You would need additional data columns to achieve your objective of finding dishes with the shortest menu duration. 

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

INFO:root:#TASK III: generate mass_edit arguments: 

 You are absolutely right!  

The provided data only lists the dishes themselves, not when they were added or removed from the menu. To figure out which dishes have been on the menu for the shortest duration, we need additional information:

* **'first_appeared' date:** The date each dish was first introduced to the menu.
* **'last_appeared' date:** The date each dish was last seen on the menu (or the current date if it's still available).


**Here's what you can do next:**

1. **Data Acquisition:**

   *  **Historical Menus:** If possible, try to find historical copies of menus from this restaurant (perhaps in archives, online collections, or through contacting the restaurant itself).
   * **Restaurant Records:** The restaurant might have internal records tracking menu changes over time.

2. **Data Enrichment:**

   * Once you have historical menu data, you can manually match dishes to their corresponding 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates. 
   * Consider using text matching techniques or natural language processing (NLP) if you have a large dataset of menus to process.

3. **Analysis:**

   * After enriching your data with dates, calculate the duration each dish was on the menu.
   * Sort the dishes by duration to identify those with the shortest time spans.

Standardize the entries in the "name" column by implementing consistent capitalization, removing unnecessary punctuation, and establishing a uniform level of detail for dish descriptions. 

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root:#TASK III: generate mass_edit arguments: 

 You're absolutely right!  Cleaning the "name" column is crucial for accurate analysis. Here's a breakdown of how we can approach standardizing it:

**1. Consistent Capitalization:**

* Convert all text to lowercase.
* Capitalize the first letter of each word (title case).

**2. Punctuation Removal:**

* Remove unnecessary punctuation like commas, periods, and parentheses.

**3. Detail Standardization:**

* This is trickier and requires some judgment calls. Here are a few strategies:

    * **Remove redundant descriptors:** For example, "Broiled Swordfish Steak Florida" could become "Broiled Swordfish Steak."
    * **Consolidate similar descriptions:**  "Roast Hot House Baby Lamb" and "Saddle of Baby Lamb Sardalaise" might be grouped under a broader category like "Lamb Dishes."
    * **Use keywords:** Focus on the core ingredients (swordfish, lamb, brisket) rather than preparation methods or sauces.

**Example Transformations:**

| Original                                       | Standardized                        |

**Tools and Techniques:**

* **Programming Languages (Python, R):** Offer powerful string manipulation functions for cleaning and standardizing text. Libraries like `pandas` in Python are excellent for working with tabular data.
* **Regular Expressions:**  Can be used to target specific patterns in the text for removal or replacement.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques:** More advanced methods can help identify synonyms, group similar dishes, and extract key information.

**Important Considerations:**


* **Context Matters:** The best standardization approach depends on your ultimate analysis goals. If you want to track specific preparation methods, you might retain some of that detail.
* **Iterative Process:** Data cleaning is often iterative. You may need to refine your rules as you examine the data and identify patterns or inconsistencies.

False 
```

**Target column:** name

**Explanations:** 

* **Accuracy:**  True (The entries appear to be accurate dish names.)
* **Relevance:** False (The 'name' column only provides the dish names. There is no information about when dishes were first or last added to the menu.)
* **Completeness:** N/A (We don't have enough context to judge completeness)
* **Conciseness:** True (Dish names appear to be consistently formatted).

**Since Relevance is False, the Flag is returned as False.** 


To achieve your objective of identifying dishes with the shortest menu duration, you would need additional columns like "first_appeared" and "last_appeared".  You'll then need to perform data cleaning and potentially transformation on those date columns to make them suitable for analysis.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the shortest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: name
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The "name" column contains inconsistent formatting and extraneous details, hindering accurate comparison of dishes for menu duration analysis.


## Data Cleaning Objective:

Standardize the format and remove unnecessary descriptions from the "name" column entries to ensure concise and consistent dish identification for subsequent analysis.

INFO:root:data cleaning objectives: ## Summarization:

The "name" column suffers from inconsistent data formatting, with some entries containing detailed dish descriptions while others only list ingredients, hindering accurate comparison and analysis.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

Standardize the "name" column by extracting concise dish names and removing extraneous details like ingredient lists or serving suggestions to ensure consistency and facilitate meaningful comparisons.

INFO:root:#TASK III: generate regexr arguments: 

 ```jython:
import re
value = re.sub(r'\([^)]*\)', '', value)  
value = re.sub(r'.*\b(with|served with|and).*', '', value).strip()
return value
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`import re`**: Imports the regular expression library for pattern matching.
2. **`value = re.sub(r'\([^)]*\)', '', value)`**: Removes any text within parentheses using a regular expression substitution. This targets descriptions like "(with vegetable salad roll)".
3. **`value = re.sub(r'.*\b(with|served with|and).*', '', value).strip()`**:  Removes text after keywords like "with", "served with", or "and" to eliminate ingredient lists and serving suggestions. `.strip()` removes any leading/trailing whitespace.
4. **`return value`**: Returns the cleaned dish name.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

 ```
False
```

**Explanations:**

* **Accuracy:**  While the data appears to be numerical, there are "0" values which are not plausible years for a dish to first appear on a menu. This indicates potential errors in the dataset. 
* **Relevance:** True (The 'first_appeared' column is directly relevant to determining the duration a dish has been on the menu).
* **Completeness:** Could be considered True, as there are no outright missing values. However, the presence of invalid "0" entries raises concerns about data completeness. 
* **Conciseness:** True (Assuming the years represent unique first appearances for each dish).

**Since Accuracy is False due to the "0" entries, the Flag must be returned as False.**  You'll need to investigate and clean those "0" values before proceeding with your analysis.

The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

*/
Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

While the "first_appeared" column contains accurate and concise year data relevant to calculating dish duration, it lacks corresponding "last_appeared" dates, making the data incomplete.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on acquiring or deriving "last_appeared" dates for each dish to enable accurate calculation of menu duration.

False
```

**Target column:** first_appeared

**Explanations:** 

* **Accuracy:**  False (The column contains values of 0 which are likely inaccurate or missing data points. Dates should not be represented as 0.)
* **Relevance:** True (The 'first_appeared' column is relevant to the objective of finding dishes with the shortest menu duration)
* **Completeness:** False (The presence of 0 values indicates missing data, impacting completeness.)
* **Conciseness:** True (All entries appear to be integers representing years, suggesting consistency in representation.)

**Since Accuracy and Completeness are evaluated as False, the Flag is returned as False.**  You'll need to address the 0 values before proceeding with your analysis. This could involve imputation, removal of rows, or further investigation into why those values are present. 

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the shortest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

While the 'first_appeared' column contains accurate and concise integer data representing years, it lacks completeness as 'last_appeared' dates are missing to calculate dish duration.


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on acquiring or deriving 'last_appeared' dates for each dish to enable the calculation of menu duration.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the shortest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

While the 'first_appeared' column contains accurate and concise integer data representing years, it lacks completeness as 'last_appeared' dates are missing to calculate dish duration.


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on acquiring or deriving 'last_appeared' dates for each dish to enable the calculation of menu duration.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the shortest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

While the 'first_appeared' column contains accurate and concise integer data representing years, it lacks completeness as 'last_appeared' dates are missing to calculate dish duration.


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on acquiring or deriving 'last_appeared' dates for each dish to enable the calculation of menu duration.

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

*/
Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the shortest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

While the 'first_appeared' column contains accurate and concise integer data representing years, it lacks completeness as 'last_appeared' dates are missing to calculate dish duration.


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on acquiring or deriving 'last_appeared' dates for each dish to enable the calculation of menu duration.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

 ```
False
```

Target column: first_appeared 
Explanations: Accuracy: True (All values are integers) * Relevance: True (column first_appeared is relavant to the Purpose)* Completeness: False (some missing values represented as 0)* Conciseness: True (no duplicates in column first_appeared). Since there are concerns with Completeness (False), I will return ```False```.  

**Further Notes:**

To achieve your objective, you'll need both 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates. The current data only provides 'first_appeared'. Additionally, the '0' values likely represent missing information and should be addressed during data cleaning.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

False
```

**Target column:** name 

**Explanations:**

* **Accuracy:**  Potentially False (Many entries are descriptive phrases rather than standardized dish names. This inconsistency could make identifying unique dishes and tracking their appearance durations difficult).
* **Relevance:** True (The 'name' column is necessary to identify the dishes for which we want to find appearance duration) 
* **Completeness:** N/A (Cannot be assessed without 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' date columns)
* **Conciseness:** False (Many entries have varying capitalization, punctuation, and descriptive elements. This lack of standardization hinders clear identification of identical dishes). 


Since Accuracy and Conciseness are likely False, the Flag should be returned as  **False**. You would need to clean and standardize the 'name' column before proceeding with the objective.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814

row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7

* **Completeness:** N/A (Cannot determine completeness without the necessary date columns)
* **Conciseness:** True (Dish names appear to be spelled consistently) 


Since Accuracy and Relevance are both flagged as False (or Unknown), the overall Flag must be set to **False**.  You would need additional data columns containing 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates to accurately determine which dishes have been on the menu for the shortest duration.

 ```jython:
import re
if re.search(r'[\[\];\.:]', value):
 return re.sub(r'[\[\];\.:]', '', value)
else:
 return value
``` 


**Explanation:**

This expression addresses the issue of invalid characters in the "name" column, which are preventing accurate analysis.  Here's a breakdown:

* **`jython:`**: Signals that the following code is Python.
* **`import re`**: Imports the regular expression library for pattern matching.
* **`if re.search(r'[\[\];\.:]', value):`**: Checks if any of the invalid characters ([, ], ;, ., :) are present in the `value` (representing a dish name).
* **`return re.sub(r'[\[\];\.:]', '', value)`**: If invalid characters are found, this line removes them using regular expression substitution.
* **`else:`**: If no invalid characters are found...
* **`return value`**: ...the original `value` is returned unchanged.

This cleaning step prepares the "name" column for further analysis by ensuring that dish names are free of characters that could interfere with date-based calculations.

* **Completeness:** N/A (We can't assess completeness without date information).
* **Conciseness:** True (Dish names seem to be consistently represented).

**Since Relevance is False**,  the Flag should return ```False```. You would need additional columns with 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates to achieve the objective.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the shortest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: name
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The "name" column is relevant for identifying dishes but lacks information needed to determine menu duration, leading to a False flag.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

To enable analysis of dish duration, the next operation should focus on adding columns indicating the 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates for each dish.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

 ```False```

**Target column:** name 

**Explanations:**

* **Accuracy:**  True (The column seems to contain accurate dish names).
* **Relevance:** False (The 'name' column doesn't provide information about when dishes were first or last served on the menu. You would need additional columns like "first_appeared" and "last_appeared" for this objective).
* **Completeness:** N/A  (We don't have enough context to judge completeness).
* **Conciseness:** True (Dish names appear to be consistently formatted).


Since Relevance is False, the Flag should be returned as ```False```. You would need additional data columns to fulfill the objective. 

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

 ```
False
```

**Target column:** first_appeared


**Explanations:**

* **Accuracy:**  False (There are values of "0" which are likely inaccurate and should be investigated as missing or placeholder data)
* **Relevance:** True (The 'first_appeared' column is directly relevant to identifying the duration a dish has been on the menu). 
* **Completeness:** Potentially False (Depending on how many "0" values there are, it might indicate a significant amount of missing data.  More context is needed about the dataset size and meaning of "0").
* **Conciseness:** True (Assuming all other numerical entries represent years, there are no apparent inconsistencies in the formatting). 


Since Accuracy is False, and potentially Completeness as well, the Flag must be returned as **False**.  The 'first_appeared' column requires cleaning before it can reliably be used for the objective.

**Target Column:** first_appeared

**Explanations:**

* **Accuracy:**  Unknown (We can't assess accuracy without seeing the actual data values in the 'first_appeared' column. Are they valid dates? Are there any inconsistencies?)
* **Relevance:** True (The 'first_appeared' column is directly relevant to determining the duration a dish has been on the menu.)
* **Completeness:** Unknown (We need to know if there are missing values in the 'first_appeared' column. A significant number of missing values would impact completeness.)
* **Conciseness:** Unknown (Without seeing the data, we can't determine if there are inconsistencies in date formatting or representation.)

**Since we cannot evaluate Accuracy, Completeness, and Conciseness without the data values,  the Flag must be returned as False. Data cleaning is necessary to assess these dimensions.** 

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa.

**Target column:** first_appeared

**Explanations:**

* **Accuracy:**  We don't have any data in the table to evaluate accuracy (e.g., are the dates formatted correctly, are they realistic?). 
* **Relevance:** True (the 'first_appeared' column is directly relevant to determining dish duration on the menu).
* **Completeness:** False (The column is empty, meaning we have no data points to work with).
* **Conciseness:** N/A (Cannot be assessed without any data)

**Since Completeness is False, the Flag must be returned as False.**  You'll need to acquire data for the 'first_appeared' column before you can proceed with your analysis.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/

row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/

When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset.

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*

row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814

Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```

row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset.

*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.

row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates.
Target column: first_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'first_appeared' column is irrelevant for analysis due to its complete lack of data, preventing assessment of accuracy and completeness. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on populating the 'first_appeared' column with accurate historical dates for each dish's introduction to the menu.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814
