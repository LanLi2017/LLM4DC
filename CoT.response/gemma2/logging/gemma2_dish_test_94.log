INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: name
row 1: Escalopine of Veal au Marsala
row 2: BEEF PEPPER STEAK.  Served with vegetable, salad, roll, and choice of potato or rice
row 3: Eischaum-Nocken
row 4: Corned Beef...On Russian Rye Bread

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:data cleaning objectives: ## Summarization:

The current dataset lacks temporal information about dish appearances, making it impossible to accurately calculate durations based solely on dish names.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on acquiring a supplementary dataset containing historical menu information to link dish names with their corresponding "first_appeared" and "last_appeared" dates.

INFO:root:#TASK III: generate mass_edit arguments: 

 You're absolutely right!  

Without timestamps or any indication of when these dishes were served, we can't determine which ones have been on the menu the longest. 

Here's a breakdown of why and what we need to do next:

**The Problem:**

* **Static Data:** The provided list is a snapshot of a menu, not a historical record.
* **Missing Temporal Information:** There are no dates associated with the dishes.

**Solution:**

1. **Historical Menu Data:** We need to find additional sources that contain past menus from this establishment (likely a restaurant). These sources could include:
    * Archived menus 
    * Newspaper advertisements featuring the menu
    * Online archives or historical societies

2. **Data Linking:** Once we have historical menu data, we'll need to link the dishes from the current list to their corresponding appearances in past menus. This might involve some manual matching based on dish names and descriptions.

3. **Calculate Duration:** After linking dishes to their appearance dates, we can calculate the duration each dish was on the menu by subtracting the "first_appeared" date from the "last_appeared" date.

False
```

**Target column:**  name 

**Explanations:**

* **Accuracy:** Potentially False (Dishes are described in various formats - some capitalized, some with punctuation, abbreviations, etc.). This inconsistency might make it hard to accurately match and compare dishes over time.
* **Relevance:** True (The 'name' column contains the dish names needed for tracking menu duration). 
* **Completeness:** N/A (Cannot assess completeness without 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' columns).
* **Conciseness:** False (There are different representations of similar dishes. For example, "BEEF PEPPER STEAK" vs "Broiled Swordfish Steak Florida"). This lack of standardization would make it difficult to group identical dishes.


Since Accuracy and Conciseness are potentially False, the overall Flag should be **False**.  You'll need to perform data cleaning to standardize dish names before determining menu duration. 

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7

## Data Cleaning Objective:

Standardize dish names by converting them to lowercase and removing unnecessary punctuation to ensure consistent representation. 

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root:#TASK III: generate mass_edit arguments: 

 You're on the right track! Standardizing the dish names is a crucial first step in accurately identifying which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration. Here's how you can approach the data cleaning process:

**1. Lowercase Conversion:**

* Convert all dish names to lowercase using Python's `.lower()` method. This will ensure consistency regardless of initial capitalization.

```python
menu['name'] = menu['name'].str.lower() 
```

**2. Punctuation Removal:**

* Remove punctuation marks like commas, periods, apostrophes, etc., using regular expressions or string manipulation techniques.

```python
import re

menu['name'] = menu['name'].apply(lambda x: re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', x))
```

**3. Handling Special Cases:**

* Some dishes might have unique formatting (e.g., "Eischaum-Nocken"). Decide whether to keep these as is or simplify them based on your analysis goals.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a dish named "Lobster, Full Order". After cleaning:

```
"lobster full order" 
```

This standardized format will make it easier to group and compare dishes accurately.

False
```

**Target column:** name 

**Explanations:**

* **Accuracy:** False (Dish names are inconsistently formatted – some capitalized, some lowercase, abbreviations used. This makes it hard to accurately identify and compare dishes.)
* **Relevance:** True (The 'name' column contains the dish names needed for the objective.)
* **Completeness:**  N/A (While there might be missing dishes, this is inherent to menu data and doesn't necessarily invalidate the analysis.)
* **Conciseness:** False (Different representations exist for the same dish – e.g., "BEEF PEPPER STEAK" vs. "Beef Pepper Steak").


**Since Accuracy and Conciseness are False, the Flag is returned as False.** 

You would need to clean the 'name' column before proceeding with the analysis. This could involve:

1. **Standardizing capitalization:** Convert all dish names to a consistent case (e.g., title case).
2. **Removing unnecessary punctuation and abbreviations:**  Clean up inconsistencies like "BEEF PEPPER STEAK" and "Roast Virginia Ham".
3. **Identifying and merging duplicates:** Ensure that variations of the same dish are grouped together ("Beef Pepper Steak" and "Pepper Steak").

col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.

*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814

row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: name
row 1: Escalopine of Veal au Marsala

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale

Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814

row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.

col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: name
row 1: Escalopine of Veal au Marsala

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.

*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa.

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' year.
Target column: name
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The "name" column suffers from inconsistent capitalization and punctuation, leading to multiple representations of the same dish.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

Standardize dish names by converting them to lowercase and removing unnecessary punctuation to ensure consistent representation.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: name
row 1: Escalopine of Veal au Marsala
row 2: BEEF PEPPER STEAK.  Served with vegetable, salad, roll, and choice of potato or rice
row 3: Eischaum-Nocken
row 4: Corned Beef...On Russian Rye Bread

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

False
```

**Target column:** last_appeared

**Explanations:** 

* **Accuracy:**  True (The values are integers representing years which seems appropriate)
* **Relevance:** True ('last_appeared' is directly relevant to determining duration on a menu)
* **Completeness:** False (Presence of '0' values suggests missing data. We don't know if these dishes were removed entirely or simply lack this information). This significantly impacts the ability to accurately calculate duration.
* **Conciseness:** True (No obvious duplicates or inconsistencies in year representation).

**Since Completeness is evaluated as False,  I will return `False` for the Flag.** The '0' values need to be addressed through data imputation or further investigation before this column can be considered clean enough for the objective.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' year.
Target column: last_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The `last_appeared` column lacks the necessary 'first_appeared' data for accurate duration calculations, impacting its accuracy and completeness despite being relevant and concise.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on adding a 'first_appeared' column to the dataset or imputing missing 'first_appeared' values if feasible based on available context.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' year.
Target column: last_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The `last_appeared` column lacks the necessary 'first_appeared' data for accurate duration calculations, impacting its accuracy and completeness despite being relevant and concise.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on adding a 'first_appeared' column to the dataset or imputing missing 'first_appeared' values if feasible based on available context.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' year.
Target column: last_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The `last_appeared` column lacks the necessary 'first_appeared' data for accurate duration calculations, impacting its accuracy and completeness despite being relevant and concise.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on adding a 'first_appeared' column to the dataset or imputing missing 'first_appeared' values if feasible based on available context.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' year.
Target column: last_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The `last_appeared` column lacks the necessary 'first_appeared' data for accurate duration calculations, impacting its accuracy and completeness despite being relevant and concise.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on adding a 'first_appeared' column to the dataset or imputing missing 'first_appeared' values if feasible based on available context.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

row 11: 1907
row 12: 1899
row 13: 1919
row 14: 1933
row 15: 1969
*/
Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' year.
Target column: last_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The `last_appeared` column lacks the necessary 'first_appeared' data for accurate duration calculations, impacting its accuracy and completeness despite being relevant and concise.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on adding a 'first_appeared' column to the dataset or imputing missing 'first_appeared' values if feasible based on available context.

Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' year.
Target column: last_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The `last_appeared` column lacks the necessary 'first_appeared' data for accurate duration calculations, impacting its accuracy and completeness despite being relevant and concise.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on adding a 'first_appeared' column to the dataset or imputing missing 'first_appeared' values if feasible based on available context.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' year.
Target column: last_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The `last_appeared` column lacks the necessary 'first_appeared' data for accurate duration calculations, impacting its accuracy and completeness despite being relevant and concise.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on adding a 'first_appeared' column to the dataset or imputing missing 'first_appeared' values if feasible based on available context.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' year.
Target column: last_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The `last_appeared` column lacks the necessary 'first_appeared' data for accurate duration calculations, impacting its accuracy and completeness despite being relevant and concise.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on adding a 'first_appeared' column to the dataset or imputing missing 'first_appeared' values if feasible based on available context.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' year.
Target column: last_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The `last_appeared` column lacks the necessary 'first_appeared' data for accurate duration calculations, impacting its accuracy and completeness despite being relevant and concise.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on adding a 'first_appeared' column to the dataset or imputing missing 'first_appeared' values if feasible based on available context.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/

Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' year.
Target column: last_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The `last_appeared` column lacks the necessary 'first_appeared' data for accurate duration calculations, impacting its accuracy and completeness despite being relevant and concise.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on adding a 'first_appeared' column to the dataset or imputing missing 'first_appeared' values if feasible based on available context.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

row 12: 1899
row 13: 1919
row 14: 1933
row 15: 1969
*/
Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' year.
Target column: last_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The `last_appeared` column lacks the necessary 'first_appeared' data for accurate duration calculations, impacting its accuracy and completeness despite being relevant and concise.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on adding a 'first_appeared' column to the dataset or imputing missing 'first_appeared' values if feasible based on available context.

Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which dishes have been on the menu for the longest duration, based on their 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' year.
Target column: last_appeared
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The `last_appeared` column lacks the necessary 'first_appeared' data for accurate duration calculations, impacting its accuracy and completeness despite being relevant and concise.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should focus on adding a 'first_appeared' column to the dataset or imputing missing 'first_appeared' values if feasible based on available context.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

```
mass_edit
```

**Explanation:**

The `name` column contains dish names with varying capitalization and punctuation.  To accurately compare dishes for duration on the menu, we need to standardize these names.  

* **`mass_edit`** will allow us to:
    * Convert all dish names to lowercase.
    * Remove unnecessary punctuation like periods and ellipses. 
    * Potentially correct minor spelling inconsistencies.

This standardization will ensure that dishes with slight variations in naming are correctly identified as the same item, leading to more accurate calculations of their duration on the menu.

The 'name' column suffers from inconsistent formatting and descriptive variations, hindering accurate dish identification. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

Standardize the 'name' column by converting all text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and resolving abbreviations to ensure consistent and concise dish descriptions.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

 ```
False 
```

**Target column:** name


**Explanations:**

* **Accuracy:**  False (The data format is inconsistent. Some entries are capitalized, others not; some include descriptions, others just names. There's also variation in punctuation and abbreviations.)
* **Relevance:** True (The 'name' column contains dish names which are relevant to determining menu duration.)
* **Completeness:** N/A (We don't have information about 'first_appeared' and 'last_appeared' dates, so we can't assess completeness for this objective.)
* **Conciseness:** False (Many dishes have elaborate descriptions along with the name. This inconsistency makes it hard to cleanly identify a single "name" for each dish.) 

Since Accuracy and Conciseness are both False, the Flag is returned as  `False`. The data cleaning pipeline should be continued to standardize the 'name' column before proceeding with the objective.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, , ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation.
