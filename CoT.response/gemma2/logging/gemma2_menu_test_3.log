INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

INFO:root:data cleaning objectives: ## Summarization:

The 'event' column suffers from accuracy issues due to inconsistent capitalization and potential spelling errors, completeness issues due to missing values, and conciseness issues due to varying descriptions for the same event type.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next data cleaning operation should focus on standardizing the capitalization and spelling in the 'event' column, and addressing the missing values before proceeding with counting distinct event types.

INFO:root:#TASK III: generate mass_edit arguments: 

 You are absolutely right!  Before we can accurately count the distinct event types, we need to clean up the "event" data. Here's a breakdown of why your observations are spot on and how we can approach the cleaning:

**Problems with the Current Data:**

* **Inconsistent Capitalization:** "Dinner," "dinner," "DINNER" all refer to the same thing but are treated as different values.
* **Spelling Variations:**  "Tiffin" vs. "tiffin" 
* **Missing Values:** Empty rows in the 'event' column will skew our count.
* **Varying Descriptions:** "Banquet and Reception Commemorating..." is much more detailed than a simple "Dinner."

**Data Cleaning Steps:**

1. **Lowercase Conversion:** Convert all event descriptions to lowercase for consistency.

2. **Spelling Correction:** Use a spell checker or a dictionary to identify and correct any misspellings.

3. **Handling Missing Values:** Decide how to handle missing values. Options include:
    * Removing rows with missing values (if they are a small percentage of the data).
    * Replacing missing values with a placeholder like "Unknown" 

4. **Standardization:** Consider creating broader categories for similar event types. For example:
    * "Breakfast," "BreakFast," "BREAKFAST" could all become "Breakfast".
    * Detailed descriptions like banquets and receptions might be grouped under "Formal Dinner Event".

**Code Example (Python):**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your data into a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv") 

# Convert to lowercase
df['event'] = df['event'].str.lower()

# Spelling correction (you might need a more sophisticated method)
df['event'] = df['event'].replace('tifin', 'tiffin')

# Handling missing values (example: replace with "Unknown")
df['event'] = df['event'].fillna("Unknown")

# ... (Add more standardization rules as needed)

# Now count distinct event types
distinct_events = df['event'].nunique()
print(f"Number of distinct event types: {distinct_events}") 
```

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

 ```
Flag: False
```

Target column: event
Explanations: Accuracy:  False (inconsistent capitalization, presence of ordinal numbers like "11TH", spelling variations like "ANNUSL" instead of "ANNUAL")* Relevance: True (column 'event' is relevant to the objective)* Completeness: False (significant number of missing values) * Conciseness: False (same event types represented differently, e.g., "LUNCHEON" and "lunch and dinner"). 

Since not all dimensions are evaluated as True, we return ```False```.  The 'event' column requires cleaning to standardize capitalization, correct spelling errors, handle ordinal numbers consistently, and address the missing values before it can be reliably used to determine distinct event types.

Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*

row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.

*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Determine the number of distinct event types in the dataset.
Target column: event
Explanation: ## Summarization:

The 'event' column suffers from accuracy issues due to inconsistent capitalization and potential spelling errors, completeness issues due to missing values, and conciseness issues due to varying descriptions for the same event type.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next data cleaning operation should focus on standardizing the capitalization and spelling in the 'event' column, and addressing the missing values before proceeding with counting distinct event types.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: event
row 1: 11TH ANNUAL BANQUET
row 2: LUNCHEON
row 3: CHRISTMAS DINNER

INFO:root:data cleaning objectives: ## Summarization:

The "event" column suffers from inconsistent naming conventions and a lack of standardization, hindering accurate analysis of distinct event types.


## Data Cleaning Objective:

Standardize event names by correcting misspellings and consolidating similar event descriptions (e.g., "LUNCHEON" and "LUNCH AND DINNER") to ensure consistent categorization.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: event
row 1: 11TH ANNUAL BANQUET
row 2: LUNCHEON
row 3: CHRISTMAS DINNER
row 4: BREAKFAST
row 5: FOURTH ANNUSL DINNER
row 6: LUNCHEON TENDERED IMPERIAL COUNCIL
row 7: lunch and dinner
row 8: breakfast
row 9: DINNER
*/
Purpose: List number of rows where the menu event is specifically marked as "DINNER".
Target column: event
Explanation: Generate proper operations to improve accuracy, completeness, conciseness of the column: event
Selected Operation:

INFO:root:

```
mass_edit
```

**Explanation:**

The goal is to accurately count rows where the event is specifically "DINNER".  There are variations in the 'event' column (e.g., "CHRISTMAS DINNER", "DINNER"). Using `mass_edit` allows us to standardize these variations to a consistent "DINNER" value, ensuring accurate counting.

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root:data cleaning objectives: ## Summarization:

The "event" column suffers from inconsistent capitalization and combined entries, hindering accurate counting of "DINNER" events.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

Standardize capitalization in the "event" column and separate combined event entries to ensure consistent and accurate identification of "DINNER" occurrences.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:

```
mass_edit
```

**Explanation:**

The goal is to accurately count rows where the event is specifically "DINNER".  Many entries use variations like "CHRISTMAS DINNER" or "FOURTH ANNUAL DINNER".  `mass_edit` allows us to standardize these variations to a consistent "DINNER" value, ensuring accurate counting.

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root:data cleaning objectives: ## Summarization:

The "event" column suffers from inconsistent capitalization and phrasing for entries related to "dinner", hindering accurate counting.

## Data Cleaning Objective:

Standardize the entries in the "event" column by converting all instances of "dinner" to a consistent lowercase format, removing extraneous words like "Christmas".

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: venue
row 1: PROF;

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: occasion
row 1: ANNUAL

row 3: RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

INFO:root:data cleaning objectives: ## Summarization:

The `location` column contains a mix of entries, some potentially representing restaurants but many not, requiring refinement to focus on eateries and address potential missing information.


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next operation should aim to filter the `location` column to retain only entries likely to be restaurants or food service establishments, while establishing a strategy for handling locations without corresponding menu data.

INFO:root:#TASK III: generate mass_edit arguments: 

 You're right on track! Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this problem and some code examples to get you started:

**1. Identifying Potential Restaurants:**

* **Keywords:** Look for words like "Restaurant," "Hotel" (often have restaurants), "Bar," "Tavern," "Cafe," "Inn."
* **Context Clues:**  Consider entries that mention specific dishes, menus, or dining experiences.

**2. Handling Missing Data:**

* **Replace with "UNKNOWN":** As you suggested, a good strategy is to replace entries where the restaurant name/location is missing with "UNKNOWN". This preserves the structure of your data while acknowledging the lack of information.

**3. Python Code Example (using Pandas):**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming your data is in a CSV file named 'restaurant_data.csv'
df = pd.read_csv('restaurant_data.csv') 

# Function to identify potential restaurants
def is_likely_restaurant(location):
  location = location.lower() # Convert to lowercase for consistency
  keywords = ["restaurant", "hotel", "bar", "tavern", "cafe", "inn"]
  for keyword in keywords:
    if keyword in location:
      return True
  return False

# Apply the function to create a new column 'is_restaurant'
df['is_restaurant'] = df['location'].apply(is_likely_restaurant)

# Filter for rows where 'is_restaurant' is True
restaurants_df = df[df['is_restaurant']]

# Replace missing locations with "UNKNOWN"
restaurants_df['location'] = restaurants_df['location'].fillna("UNKNOWN")

print(restaurants_df) 
```

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

```
mass_edit
``` 

**Explanation:**

The goal is to identify sponsors who accept dollars.  Some sponsors might have names that imply dollar acceptance (e.g., "Restaurant" suggests they take payment). However, others are less clear (e.g., "TRUSTEES OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN").

Using `mass_edit`, we can:

* **Group similar entities:** Combine variations like "Spilker's Restaurant and Grill Room" and "Adams' Restaurant" into a broader category like "Restaurants".
* **Standardize names:**  Convert "Southern Pacific" and "Seaboard Railway" to a consistent format like "Railroad Companies".

This will help focus the analysis on sponsor types more likely to accept dollars.

INFO:root:data cleaning objectives: ## Summarization:

While the "sponsor" column is relevant and complete, potential inaccuracies in sponsor names and a lack of information about Dollar acceptance necessitate further data cleaning. 


## Data Cleaning Objective:

The next step in data cleaning should focus on enriching the dataset with a new column indicating which sponsors accept Dollars, followed by standardizing sponsor names and deduplicating entries for improved accuracy and consistency.

INFO:root:#TASK III: generate mass_edit arguments: 

 You're right on target!  Here's a breakdown of why your analysis is spot-on and how to proceed with data cleaning:

**Strengths of Your Analysis:**

* **Identifying the Key Issue:** You correctly pinpoint that while the "sponsor" column is valuable, it lacks crucial information about Dollar acceptance.
* **Understanding Data Limitations:** Recognizing potential inaccuracies in sponsor names and the absence of a "Dollar Acceptance" indicator highlights the need for further cleaning.
* **Proposing Clear Next Steps:** Your suggestion to add a "Dollar Acceptance" column and standardize/deduplicate sponsor names is an excellent roadmap for improvement.

**Data Cleaning Action Plan:**

1. **"Dollar Acceptance" Column:**
   - Create a new binary column (e.g., "Accepts_Dollars") with values of either "Yes" or "No."
   -  Initially, populate this column with "Unknown" for all entries.

2. **Manual Review and Research:**
   - For each sponsor, conduct research (online searches, historical records) to determine if they historically accepted Dollars.
   - Update the "Accepts_Dollars" column accordingly.

3. **Standardization:**
   - Address variations in sponsor names (e.g., "Hotel St. Regis" vs. "St. Regis Hotel").
   - Consider using a library like `fuzzywuzzy` in Python to help identify potential matches.

4. **Deduplication:**
   - Remove duplicate entries for the same sponsor, consolidating information into a single row.

**Additional Considerations:**

Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.

row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa.
