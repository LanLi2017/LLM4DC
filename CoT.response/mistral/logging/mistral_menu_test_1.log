INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root: ["page_count"]
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: page_count
row 1: 1.0
row 2: 2.0
row 3: 4.0
row 4: 2.0
row 5: 2.0
row 6: 2.0
row 7: 4.0
row 8: 2.0
row 9: 3.0
row 10: 4.0
row 11: 1.0
row 12: 1.0
row 13: 4.0
row 14: 2.0
row 15: 8.0

INFO:root: ["page_count"]
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: page_count
row 1: 4.0

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: event
row 1: MENU

Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Explanation: Expression starts with "jython:",  "return" statement is used to end the execution of the function call. code in-between "jython:" and "return value" is to parse capture the pattern of cell values in target column (assuming it's the same as the current one). If the cell contains 'menu event', then add a comma and append 'menu event' to the original value, else return the original value.
Output: 32463, menu event | 27147 | 23580 | 26336, menu event | 34038 | 31432 | 31437 | 27374 | 13714, menu event | 33189, menu event | 33147 | 32747 | 20197 | 23179 | 28574 | 20904 | 28250 | 24304 | 35307 | 21960

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  Based on the given table and objective, there is no column named "menu event" or any similar column that suggests a relationship to a menu event. Therefore, it's impossible to identify rows with a specific value (e.g., "LUNCHEON") in this context. So, the Flag would be ```False```. However, if you meant to ask for another column related to the objective (for example, if there is a "EventType" or "MenuOption" column), I would need to adjust my analysis accordingly.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: venue
row 1: COMMERCIAL
row 2: POL;
row 3: COMMERCIAL
row 4: COMMERCIAL
row 5: COM
*/
Purpose: Identify the number of unique venues present in the dataset.
Target column: venue

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  Based on the provided table and objective, it is not possible to determine if the data is clean enough as there is no column named "menu" or any indication of a "Daily" occasion in the provided data. Therefore, I cannot evaluate the accuracy, relevance, completeness, and conciseness of the target column. Hence, I will return ```False```.

To provide a more accurate evaluation, it would be necessary to have a table containing menus with their associated occasions, including a "Daily" occasion if applicable. Then, we could assess the data quality based on the four dimensions provided.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

  Flag: ```False```

Target column: event
Explanations: Accuracy: False (there is inconsistency in spelling and representation, e.g., "DINNER (?)", "THANKSGIVING DINNER", "ALL AMERICAN BANQUET IN HONOR OF EDWIN C. HALL")* Relevance: True (column event exists)* Completeness: N/A (with minor number of missing values in column event but it can be ignored)* Conciseness: False (inconsistencies exist in column event)*. Since there are concerns with Accuracy and Conciseness, I will return ```False```.

In this case, we have to standardize the spellings for "DINNER" instances to a single format (e.g., "Dinner") before returning True for the Flag.

Explanation: The expression starts with "jython:",  "return" statement is used to end the execution of the function call. The code in-between "jython:" and "return value" is to parse capture the pattern of cell values in target column 'event'. The code checks if the cell value contains words like LUNCH, DINNER, BREAKFAST, LUNCHEON, PRIVATE BANQUET, 11TH ANNUAL BANQUET, 4TH ANNUSL DINNER or PERSONALLY CONDUCTED TOUR THROUGH MEXICO & CALIFORNIA. If it does, the code checks for additional patterns like AND, [, ], ;, : and removes them if found. The purpose is to ensure that the 'event' column represents daily menus appropriately by removing unnecessary characters and formatting.

 ```regexr_transform```
Explanation: The objective is to obtain additional data or context that will enable the transformation and cleaning of the 'event' column to ensure it represents daily menus appropriately. A regular expression-based function can be used to extract information about the day associated with each event, such as "DINNER" possibly indicating an evening event, but not necessarily a daily one. The function could look like this:

```python
import re
def extract_day(value):
    match = re.search(r' (am|pm|morning|afternoon|evening|night)', value)
    if match:
        return match.group(0)
    else:
        return None
```

This function will help in identifying the time of day associated with each event, which can then be used to determine whether they are daily events or not.

INFO:root:data cleaning objectives: 1. Summary: The data quality assessment indicates that the 'event' column needs standardization for accuracy, as the data type is inconsistent.

2. Data Cleaning Objective: Standardize the 'event' column values to a consistent format (e.g., lowercase or a specific language) for improving data accuracy.

INFO:root:#TASK III: generate regexr arguments: 

  ```jython:import re\nvalue = value.lower()\nreturn value```
Explanation: Expression starts with "jython:",  "return" statement is used to end the execution of the function call. code in-between "jython:" and "return value" is to parse capture the pattern of cell values in target column "event". "value" parameter represents a single cell in the target column "event". The code in-between is to convert all the characters in the cell values of target column event to lowercase.
Output: daily menu | personally conducted tour through mexico & california | luncheon | banquet and reception commemorating 50 years since the admission of honorable james tyndale mitchell,ll.d. chief justice of the supreme court of pa to the bar of philadelphia | dinner | 15nth burns anniversay | dinner | private banquet | dinner to queen alexandre & princess victoria of russia | dinner | dinner | tiffin | luncheon tenderered imperial council | dinner |

Note: The output is in lowercase as per the standardization requirement.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: occasion
row 1: ?
row 2: COMPLIMENTARY/TESTIMONIAL
row 3: COMPLIMENTARY/TESTIMONIAL
row 4: DAILY
row 5: OTHER (DAILY);

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

INFO:root:data cleaning objectives:  Summary: The current data quality assessment for the 'page_count' column indicates no issues in accuracy, relevance, completeness, or conciseness. However, to identify the highest dish count-to-page count ratio and potentially determine if a menu page redesign is necessary, an additional "dish_count" column needs to be included in the dataset for further analysis.

   Data Cleaning Objective: Incorporate a new 'dish_count' column into the dataset to enable the calculation of dish count-to-page count ratios and facilitate a more accurate assessment of menu page design requirements.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  Flag: ```False```
   Target column: page_count
   Explanations: Accuracy: True (data type in column page_count is numeric)* Relevance: True (column page_count exists and relevant to the Purpose)* Completeness: False (13 out of 20 locations have missing values in column page_count)* Conciseness: True (no duplicates or incorrect variations exist in column page_count)*. Since there are concerns with Completeness (False), I will return ```False```. The data cleaning pipeline should continue to fill the missing values for this column.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

  ```jython:import re
   if not re.search(r'\$', value):
      return value + ' (Accepts Dollars)'
   else:
      return value```

Explanation: Expression starts with "jython:",  "return" statement is used to end the execution of the function call. code in-between "jython:" and "return value" is to parse capture the pattern of cell values in target column "sponsor". "value" parameter represents a single cell in the target column "sponsor". The code in-between is to find if the cell contains "$" or not. If it does not contain, then append "(Accepts Dollars)" to the original value. If it already contains "$", then return the original value as it is.

Output: United States Senate Office Building Restaurant (Accepts Dollars) | Holland America Cruises | ASTOR HOUSE | STATLER'S HOTEL AND RESTAURANT (Accepts Dollars) | Yamato (Accepts Dollars) | Waldorf Astoria (Accepts Dollars) | Hotel Belvedere (Accepts Dollars) | AMEN CORNER AXE | Casina Delle Rose & Lucciola (Accepts Dollars) | The Mayflower Hotel (Accepts Dollars) | The Four Seasons (Accepts Dollars) | S.S.

We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*

row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  Flag: `False`

Target column: sponsor
Explanations:
- Accuracy: False (The objective requires a specific value for "accepts Dollars", but the provided data does not contain this information)
- Relevance: True (column sponsor exists in dataset)
- Completeness: N/A (no missing values in column sponsor)
- Conciseness: True (no duplicates or inconsistent spellings in column sponsor)

Since there are concerns with Accuracy and the objective cannot be met, I will return `False`. The data cleaning pipeline would need to add a new column indicating whether each sponsor accepts Dollars.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  `False`

Target column: sponsor
Explanations: Accuracy: False (various inconsistent spellings and formats in column sponsor)* Relevance: True (column sponsor exists)* Completeness: N/A (with minor number of missing values in column sponsor but it can be ignored)* Conciseness: False (inconsistent spellings for the same entities exist in column sponsor)*. Since there are concerns with Accuracy and Conciseness (False), I will return ```False```.
In this case, it would not be possible to identify sponsors who have published that they accept Dollars based on the provided data due to inconsistencies and lack of standardization. A data cleaning pipeline would need to be applied to standardize and clean the column sponsor before proceeding with the objective.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

   elif re.search(r'([A-Za-z]+)', value):
      return value.lower()
   else:
      return value```

Explanation: Expression starts with "jython:",  "return" statement is used to end the execution of the function call. code in-between "jython:" and "return value" is to parse capture the pattern of cell values in target column "sponsor". "value" parameter represents a single cell in the target column "sponsor". The code in-between is to find all the matching cells in "value" (target column sponsor) with the regular expression match = re.search(r'\b([A-Za-z]+) ([A-Za-z]+)\b', value), and then use lower() function to convert all the letters to lowercase, and capitalize() function to make the first letter of each word in the second group capitalized. If the cell does not match the pattern, it will check if there is any word in the cell using re.search(r'([A-Za-z]+)', value), if yes, then convert all the letters to lowercase.

*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  Flag: `False`

Target column: sponsor
Explanations:
- Accuracy: False (different representations of the same entities, for example "USMS", "U.S.M.S.", etc.)
- Relevance: True (column sponsor is relevant to the Purpose, as it could potentially indicate different vendors offering services or products)
- Completeness: N/A (all values available in column sponsor but it is not clear if this information can be used to determine the number of dishes offered)
- Conciseness: False (different representations of the same entities exist in column sponsor)

Since there are concerns with Accuracy and Conciseness (False), I will return `False`. The data cleaning pipeline should continue to clean and standardize the data, such as removing unnecessary spaces and converting all entity names to a consistent format.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  Flag: `False`

   Target column: sponsor

   Explanations:

   Accuracy: False (incorrect capitalization and inconsistencies in spellings for the same sponsors)
   Relevance: True (column sponsor is relavant to the Purpose, even though it may not be directly related to the number of dishes)
   Completeness: N/A (with minor number of missing values in column sponsor but it can be ignored)
   Conciseness: False (incorrect variations does exist in column sponsor)

   Since there are concerns with Accuracy and Conciseness (False), I will return `False`. A data cleaning pipeline would be needed to clean up the inconsistencies in the sponsor column.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Find the sponsors that offer the highest number of dishes on their menu.
Target column: sponsor
Explanation:  Summary: The profiling results indicate that the dataset has inconsistencies in data type and representation for the 'sponsor' column, which affects accuracy and conciseness.

Data Cleaning Objective: Standardize the format of the 'sponsor' column by converting all values to a consistent data type (either strings or lists) and standardizing the spellings for the same sponsors to improve data quality.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  Flag: ```False```
   Target column: sponsor
   Explanations: Accuracy: N/A (column sponsor has inconsistent data types, some are strings and some are arrays)* Relevance: True (column sponsor is relavant to the Purpose)* Completeness: N/A (with minor number of missing values in column sponsor but it can be ignored)* Conciseness: False (different representations for the same entity exist in column sponsor like RESTAURANT NAME AND/OR LOCATION NOT GIVEN and [])*. Since there are concerns with Accuracy (False) and some quality dimensions are not True, I will return ```False```. It's important to clean the data before moving forward.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root: ['sponsor', 'event']
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Purpose: Identify which sponsors offer breakfast.
Target column: sponsor
Explanation:  Summary: There are inconsistencies in the spelling and format of sponsor names, as well as different representations for the same semantics, which makes it difficult to analyze the data accurately.

   Data Cleaning Objective: Standardize the spellings of the sponsor names to improve the accuracy and conciseness of the dataset for better analysis.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  `False`

Target column: sponsor
Explanations: Accuracy: False (inconsistent format and representation in the column)* Relevance: True (column sponsor exists)* Completeness: N/A (with minor number of missing values in column sponsor but it (7/20) can be ignored)* Conciseness: N/A (different variations exist in column sponsor, some are restaurants and others are not). Since there are concerns with Accuracy (False), I will return ```False```.
To clean the data, we need to standardize the spelling of restaurant names and also add a separate column for the type of service offered by each sponsor.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

   One-sentence data cleaning objective: To identify which sponsors offer breakfast, we need to either find another column indicating the type of service offered (e.g., "breakfast", "lunch", "dinner") or gather more specific information about the sponsors' services in order to filter and extract relevant data.

  ```jython:import re
   if re.search(r'\b(Breakfast|breakfast)\b', value, re.IGNORECASE):
      return value
   else:
      return value```
Explanation: Expression starts with "jython:",  "return" statement is used to end the execution of the function call. code in-between "jython:" and "return value" is to parse capture the pattern of cell values in target column "sponsor". "value" parameter represents a single cell in the target column "sponsor". The code in-between is to find all the matching cells in "value" (target column sponsor) with the regular expression match = re.search(r'\b(Breakfast|breakfast)\b', value, re.IGNORECASE), which will return True if it finds either 'Breakfast' or 'breakfast'. If found, it returns the original value; else, it returns the original value as well.
Output: The output depends on whether any of the sponsors offer breakfast and how they are named in the dataset. If no sponsor offers breakfast, then all values will be returned unchanged. If some sponsors offer breakfast, only those rows with the matching pattern will be returned.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  Flag: ```False```
   Target column: sponsor (not directly related to the objective)
   Explanations: Accuracy: N/A (No clear pattern or specific values indicating if sponsors offer breakfast)* Relevance: False (column sponsor is not relavant to the Purpose of identifying which sponsors offer breakfast)* Completeness: N/A (Since we cannot determine completeness without knowing if any sponsors in this dataset offer breakfast)* Conciseness: True (no duplicates or inconsistent spellings exist in column sponsor)*. Since there are concerns with Relevance and Accuracy (False or N/A), I will return ```False```.
   To further process the data cleaning pipeline, it is necessary to find a way to identify if any of the sponsors offer breakfast, such as adding a 'breakfast' column based on other data sources or creating new features from existing data.

Since there are concerns with Accuracy, I will return ```False```. To clean the data, you can standardize the spelling for the 'DINNER' events.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/

Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814

row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.

Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  `False`

Target column: event
Explanations: Accuracy: False (some entries in the column event have inconsistent spelling of 'annual', 'annusl')* Relevance: True (column event is relavant to the Purpose)* Completeness: N/A (with minor number of missing values in column event but it (1/15) can be ignored)* Conciseness: False (different spellings for 'annual' and 'banquet')*. Since there are concerns with Accuracy (False), I will return `False`. The data cleaning pipeline should continue to standardize the spelling in the 'event' column.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:

 `regexr_transform`

The selected operation is `regexr_transform`. This operation will be used to search for patterns in the sponsor names that might indicate if they offer lunch. For example, we can look for common words like "Restaurant", "Cafe", "Hotel" etc., which are often associated with establishments offering food services including lunch.

Here's a simple example of how the regex pattern could look:

```python
import re
def check_for_lunch(value):
    match = re.search(r'(?i)(restaurant|cafe|hotel)', value)
    if match:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function will return `True` for sponsors that have "Restaurant", "Cafe", or "Hotel" in their name, and `False` otherwise. You can then apply this function to the entire column using a pandas DataFrame operation like `apply()`.

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root:data cleaning objectives:  Summary: The target column 'sponsor' has accurate and concise spellings, but it is unclear if they all represent unique entities offering lunch, so the relevance needs further confirmation.

   Data Cleaning Objective: To verify the relevance of each sponsor in the 'sponsor' column by determining whether they offer lunch or not.
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root:#TASK III: generate regexr arguments: 

  ```jython:import re
   match = re.search(r'\b(lunch|dinner)\b', value.lower(), re.IGNORECASE)
   if match:
      return 'Yes'
   else:
      return 'No'```

Explanation: The expression starts with "jython:",  "return" statement is used to end the execution of the function call. Code in-between "jython:" and "return" is to parse capture the pattern of cell values in target column "sponsor". "value" parameter represents a single cell in the target column "sponsor". The code in-between is to find if the cell value contains 'lunch' or 'dinner' (case insensitive) using re.IGNORECASE flag. If found, return 'Yes', else return 'No'. This will help us identify whether each sponsor offers lunch or not, which can be used for further analysis.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  Based on the table contents and provided objective, I would check for a clear pattern of "lunch" or "restaurant" in the sponsor column. Since there are no instances where this information is explicitly stated (e.g., Hanover Lunch), it would be challenging to identify which sponsors offer lunch based on the given data. Therefore, I will return ```False```.

For a more accurate result, additional context or columns (like location type) may be necessary to filter out sponsors that offer lunch.

Purpose: Identify which sponsors offer lunch.
Target column: sponsor
Explanation:  Summary: The target column 'sponsor' has accurate and concise spellings, but it is unclear if they all represent unique entities offering lunch, so the relevance needs further confirmation.

   Data Cleaning Objective: To verify the relevance of each sponsor in the 'sponsor' column by determining whether they offer lunch or not.

 `regexr_transform`

Explanation: The selected operation is `regexr_transform`. This operation will be used to search for patterns within the 'sponsor' column that might indicate if a sponsor offers lunch or not. For example, we can look for common words associated with restaurants or hotels (e.g., "restaurant", "hotel", "cafe", etc.) and check if any of these patterns are present in the sponsor names. This will help us identify which sponsors offer lunch based on their names.

Here's a simple example of how the regexr_transform operation could be applied:

```python
import re

def has_lunch(row):
    return bool(re.search(r"restaurant|hotel|cafe", row["sponsor"]))

# Apply the function to each row in the table
lunch_providers = [row for row in table if has_lunch(row)]
```

In this example, `has_lunch()` is a custom function that checks if a sponsor name contains any of the specified words (restaurant, hotel, or cafe). The resulting list `lunch_providers` will contain only those rows where the sponsor offers lunch.

INFO:root:#TASK III: generate regexr arguments: 

  ```jython:import re
   if re.search(r'\b[A-Z]{2,}\s?Lunch\b', value):
      return 'Lunch' + ' ' + value
   elif re.search(r'\b[A-Z]{2,}\s?Hotel\b', value):
      return 'Hotel' + ' ' + value
   elif re.search(r'\b[A-Z]{2,}\s?Cruises\b', value):
      return 'Cruise' + ' ' + value
   elif re.search(r'\b[A-Z]{2,}\s?Room\b', value):
      return 'Room' + ' ' + value
   else:
      return value```
Explanation: Expression starts with "jython:",  "return" statement is used to end the execution of the function call. code in-between "jython:" and "return value" is to parse capture the pattern of cell values in target column "sponsor". "value" parameter represents a single cell in the target column "sponsor". The code in-between is to find if the sponsor name contains 'Lunch', 'Hotel', 'Cruises' or 'Room' and append them accordingly. If not found, return the original value.
Output: Lunch | Hotel | Cruise | Room | TOYO KISEN KAISHA | Hotel St. Regis | Southern Pacific | The Brass Rail | FRATERNAL UNION OF ANOINTED HIGH PRIESTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK | TRUSTEES OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN | Comstock Room Of The Palace Hotel | Hotel Belvedere | S.S.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  Flag: ```False```
   Target column: sponsor
   Explanations:
   - Accuracy: True (correct spellings for the same sponsor names and same format in column sponsor)
   - Relevance: True (column sponsor is relavant to the Purpose, even though not all sponsors are offering lunch)
   - Completeness: False (not enough data instances in column sponsor to determine if any offer lunch)
   - Conciseness: True (incorrect variations does not exist in column sponsor)*. Since there are concerns with Completeness (False), I will return ```False```.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*
col: sponsor
row 1: ?
