INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

        row['sponsor'] = sponsor
    return data
```

Explanation: The expression provided above is a Python function that takes a table as input and iterates through each row. It standardizes the spellings and format of the sponsor names in the 'sponsor' column, ensuring consistency across all entries. Specific cases are handled using regular expressions (re.sub) to replace certain patterns with standardized versions. The expression also adds an apostrophe for Delmonico's and standardizes the breakfast representation.

Output: After applying this function to the provided table, you will get a cleaned table where all sponsor names are standardized, and any occurrences of breakfast are represented consistently.

Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*

Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

*/
Purpose: Identify which sponsors offer breakfast.
Target column: event
Explanation:  Summary: The assessment of profiling results from four dimensions indicates false accuracy due to the absence of 'breakfast' events in the dataset.

   Data Cleaning Objective: To improve data quality, it is necessary to clean or preprocess the data by either adding missing values (if applicable) related to breakfast events or transforming event names into a consistent format that includes breakfast terms.
Selected Operation:

INFO:root:data cleaning objectives: 1. Summary: The provided data does not contain information about sponsors, making it impossible to determine if any sponsors offer breakfast.
   2. Data Cleaning Objective: Include additional data (such as sponsor names or event details) in the dataset to enable a correct evaluation of whether any sponsors offer breakfast.
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root:#TASK III: generate regexr arguments: 

  Here's an expression that could potentially help identify if any events are related to breakfast, given the current dataset structure and lack of explicit sponsor information:

```jython:import re
breakfast_events = []
for row in range(1, len(data['event'])):
    event = data['event'][row]
    if re.search(r'BREAKFAST|FRUHSTUCK', event, re.IGNORECASE):  # Case-insensitive search for 'breakfast' or 'Fruhstuck'
        breakfast_events.append(event)
if len(breakfast_events) > 0:
    print("Sponsors offering breakfast: ", ', '.join(breakfast_events))
else:
    print("No sponsor information available to determine if any offer breakfast.")```

This expression iterates through each event in the dataset, performs a case-insensitive search for 'breakfast' or 'Fruhstuck', and appends any matching events to a list. If at least one event is found, it prints out the events related to breakfast. Otherwise, it indicates that no sponsor information is available to determine if any offer breakfast.

Please note that this expression assumes that the dataset is named 'data' and has been imported as a pandas DataFrame with columns 'event'. Also, it assumes that the event names contain the word 'breakfast' or 'Fruhstuck' if they are related to breakfast events. This might not be accurate for all datasets, so you may need to adjust the regular expression pattern accordingly.

Lastly, this expression does not directly answer the question about which competition(s) were hosted before 1998, as it focuses on identifying potential sponsors offering breakfast based on the provided dataset structure and lack of explicit sponsor information. To address that purpose, you would need to use a different approach, such as the one provided in the previous example.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.

INFO:root:#TASK III: generate regexr arguments: 

  Here's an expression to identify sponsors offering lunch based on common names of establishments known to provide lunch services. This expression is not perfect and may require adjustments depending on the specific context and additional data.

```jython:import re
def find_lunch_providers(row):
    restaurant = row['sponsor'].lower()
    if re.search(r'(restaurant|hotel|inn|cafe|bistro|diner|cruise|club)\b', restaurant) and 'lunch' in restaurant:
        return True
    elif any([re.search(r'(restaurant|hotel|inn|cafe|bistro|diner|cruise|club)', part) for part in restaurant.split(' ') if part]:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Apply the function to each row
lunch_providers = [find_lunch_providers(row) for row in rows]
```

Explanation: The expression defines a function `find_lunch_providers()` that takes a single row as an argument. It checks if the sponsor's name contains common words associated with restaurants or hotels and also checks if the word 'lunch' is present in the name. If either of these conditions is met, it returns True, indicating that the sponsor offers lunch services. The function is case-insensitive due to using `lower()` on the restaurant name.

The expression uses list comprehension to apply this function to each row in the dataset and store the results in a new list called `lunch_providers`. This list can then be used for further analysis or filtering of the data based on lunch providers.

INFO:root:#TASK IV: data quality inspection: 

  Flag: `False`

Target column: sponsor
Explanations: Accuracy: True (all values have correct spellings for the same names and same format in column sponsor)* Relevance: N/A (it's not clear from the table if any of these sponsors offer lunch or not, this information is not provided)* Completeness: N/A (there are some missing values in column sponsor but it can be ignored for this objective)* Conciseness: True (incorrect variations do not exist in column sponsor)*. Since there are no concerns with the quality dimensions and the table does not provide information on whether any of these sponsors offer lunch, I will return ```False```. In order to identify which sponsors offer lunch, additional data would be required.
INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

Explanation: The expression defines a function `standardize_sponsor(value)` that takes a sponsor name as input and returns a standardized version of the name. It first removes any non-alphabetic characters from the name using regular expressions, then converts the name to lowercase for easier comparison. Finally, it replaces common variations of sponsor names with a consistent spelling. This function can be applied to each cell in the 'sponsor' column to improve the accuracy and conciseness of the data.

To identify which sponsors offer lunch, we would need additional information about which sponsors provide lunch services. However, based on the provided table contents, purpose, and current operation purpose, this expression standardizes the spelling of sponsor names and ensures a consistent format for all values in the 'sponsor' column to improve accuracy and conciseness.

col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

  Flag: ```False```

Target column: event
Explanations: Accuracy: False (data type in the event column is not consistent)* Relevance: True (column event exists)* Completeness: N/A (with minor number of missing values in column event but it (1/13) can be ignored)* Conciseness: False (incorrect variations for "lunch" does exist in column event as "LUNCHEON", "BREAKFAST AND RECEPTION COMMEMORATING 50 YEARS SINCE THE ADMISSION OF HONORABLE JAMES TYNDALE MITCHELL,LL.D CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF PA TO THE BAR OF PHILADELPHIA" and "ZWEITES FRUHSTUCK")*. Since there are some concerns with Accuracy (False) and not all of the dimensions are True, I will return ```False```.

In this case, it's essential to clean and standardize the "event" column by converting all lunch-related entries into a consistent format like "Lunch", "lunch", or "luncheon". Additionally, removing unnecessary descriptions could help improve the accuracy of the data.

The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.
/*

Inside this function, it checks if the value contains either 'lunch' or 'dinner' (case-insensitive) using the `re.search()` method. If it finds a match, it returns the original value; otherwise, it returns None.

The expression then applies this function to each row in the table by iterating through the rows and splitting them into individual elements based on spaces. For each event, it calls the `clean_event()` function and appends the result (if not None) to a list called `sponsors_offering_lunch`. This list will contain only the events related to sponsors offering lunch.

INFO:root:#TASK II: select operations: 

 Instruction: You are a data cleaning expert and need to prepare the table for future analysis by choosing the most appropriate cleaning Operations. Your goal is to improve the data's format, conciseness, and usability, but do not directly solve the analysis Purpose. Instead, focus on making the data well-structured and clean for further use.
The Operations pool you can choose from contains ```upper```,  ```trim```, ```mass_edit```,  ```regexr_transform```, ```numeric```, and ```date```.

Following examples demostrate the usage of each data cleaning Operation. 

1. ```upper```: The upper function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are strings into uppercase, fixing formatting error for strings. For example,

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | Ohare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Target column: neighbourhood
Explanation: Improve conciseness: The format of cell values in column neighbourhood are inconsistent(mixed with different formats). Therefore, We use upper on column "neighbourhood" to make the format consistent as Uppercase.
Selected Operation: ```upper```
Output: OHARE | OHARE | OHARE

2. ```trim```: The trim function is designed to remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset, and can be applied universally. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Book Title
Explanation: Improve accuracy: There are extra whitespaces in some cell values on column Book Title, therefore, we trim the column to remove extra white spaces in the cell values.
Selected Operation: ```trim```
Output: Against Method. | Changing Order | Exceeding Our Grasp

3. ```mass_edit```: The mass_edit operation is used to replace a group of similar or related cell values with a string or categorical value across multiple cells.  When the same data is represented differently (e.g., spelling variations or abbreviations), replace them to a single consistent value. For example,
/*
col : | LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : | 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : | 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : | 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : | 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : | 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : | 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Target column: City
Explanation: Improve conciseness and accuracy: cell values spellings for Hon, HONOLULU are incorrect and duplicate with "Honolulu" should be clustered and replaced with Honolulu. similar to CHI and Chicago should be edited to Chicago.
Selected Operation: ```mass_edit```
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | urbana | Chicago

4. ```regexr_transform```: The regexr_transform function is a function that utilizes regular expressions. This function can be particularly useful for extracting, replacing, or transforming parts of text data based on defined patterns. For example,

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 : Against Method.      | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 : Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/
Target column: Year
Explanation: Improve relavancy and accuracy: cell values in column Year are not accurate enough, which are composed with author information and year info. We implement a regular expression-based function: "jython:import re\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\d{4}\\b', value)\nif match:\n   return match.group(0)" to extract year.
Selected Operation: ```regexr_transform```
Output: 1975| 1985 | 2006

5. ```numeric```: numeric is an operation that identifies and transforms numeric data entries (e.g., strings of decimal float or integers) into their proper numerical format, ensuring they are correctly recognized and treated as numbers in the dataset. For example, float number "2.0" would be converted to "2".

/*
col : | code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : | 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939370.0 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : | 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649931.0 | kwale
row 3 : | 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1109735.0 | kilifi
*/
Target column: population; census 2009
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in column population; census 2009 are float which is incorrect. Therefore, numeric is chosen to convert the data into correct integers.
Selected Operation: ```numeric```
Output: 939370 | 649311 | 1109735

6. ```date```: The date function is used to convert all **string-type** cell values in a column that are datetime-like into ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), fixing formatting errors for date type data. For example,

/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
*/
Target column: Publish Date
Explanation: Improve accuracy: The cell values in Publish Date are in different date format, therefore, We use date on column "Publish Date" to normalize all the dates into ISO format.
Selected Operation: ```date```
Output: 2005-10-04T00:00:00Z | 2008-09-14T00:00:00Z | 2009-10-12T00:00:00Z

Note that all operations must work on the CORRECT types of data. For instance, ```numeric``` cannot work on strings or date-time cell values. Verse visa. 

 Based on table contents and Purpose provided as following, select a proper Operation from the ['upper', 'trim', 'mass_edit', 'regexr_transform', 'numeric', 'date'] and output the operation name in ``` ```.

INFO:root:#TASK III: generate regexr arguments: 

  ```jython:import re

def standardize_sponsor(value):
    # Remove any non-alphabetic characters, except hyphens and spaces
    value = re.sub(r'\W+', ' ', value)

    # Capitalize the first letter of each word
    words = value.split()
    capitalized_words = [word.capitalize() for word in words]

    # Join the words back together with a single space between them
    standardized_value = ' '.join(capitalized_words)

    return standardized_value

# Apply the function to each sponsor name in the table
for row in range(1, 21):
    sponsor = input("Enter the sponsor for row " + str(row) + ": ")
    standardized_sponsor = standardize_sponsor(sponsor)
    print("Standardized sponsor: ", standardized_sponsor)
```

Explanation: The provided expression uses a Python function to clean and standardize the spelling of the sponsor names. It removes any non-alphabetic characters, except hyphens and spaces, capitalizes the first letter of each word, and joins the words back together with a single space between them. This helps improve data quality and accuracy by making the sponsor names consistent in their spelling and formatting.

The function is then applied to each sponsor name in the table using a loop that reads the sponsor for each row from user input, standardizes it, and prints the standardized version of the sponsor name. This allows us to identify which sponsors offer dinner based on the standardized names.
