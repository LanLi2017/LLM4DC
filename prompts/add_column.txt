To answer the question, we can first use add_column() to add more columns.

Here are a few format types you could choose to generate the expression in add_column:
1. cells["Column 1"].value + " "+ cells["Column 2"].value 
Create a new column by concatenate cell values from Column 1 and Column 2 with a white space as the concatenator (default).
2. cells["Column 1"].value + ";" + cells["Column 2"].value 
Create a new column by concatenate cell values from Column 1 and Column 2 by semicolon (note that you could choose any concatenator according to the purpose)
3. value
Create a new column by duplicating the cell values from the target column.


Examples of expression, new_column arguments prediction for operation add_column() are as following.

/*
col : week | when | kickoff | opponent | results; final score | results; team record | game site | attendance
row 1 : 1 | saturday, april 13 | 7:00 p.m. | at rhein fire | w 27–21 | 1–0 | rheinstadion | 32,092
row 2 : 2 | saturday, april 20 | 7:00 p.m. | london monarchs | w 37–3 | 2–0 | waldstadion | 34,186
row 3 : 3 | sunday, april 28 | 6:00 p.m. | at barcelona dragons | w 33–29 | 3–0 | estadi olímpic de montjuïc | 17,503
*/
Purpose: Return top 5 competitions that have the most attendance.
Current Operation Purpose: number of attendance is duplicated based on the column attendance
Expression: ```value```, New_column: ```attendance number```
Explanation: We copy the value from column "attendance" and create a new column "attendance number" for each row.
Output: 32,092 | 34,186 | 17,503


/*
col : rank | lane | player name| country | time
row 1 :  | 5 | olga tereshkova |  kaz    | 51.86
row 2 :  | 6 | manjeet kaur    |  ind    | 52.17
row 3 :  | 3 | asami tanno     |  jpn    | 53.04
*/
Purpose: return the player information, including both name and country concatenating by "-"
Current Operation Purpose: a new column named player information is created by concatenating cell values from column player name and country
Expression: ```cells['player name'].value+ "-"+ cells['country'].value```, New_column: ```player```
Explanation: We add a new column based on concatenating the value from column "player name" and "country" for each row.
Output: olga tereshkova-kaz | manjeet kaur-ind | asami tanno-jpn
