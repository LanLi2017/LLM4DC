The date function is used to convert all cell values in a column that are datetime-like into a standardized ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD). This is especially useful for ensuring consistency in date representation across a dataset, which can facilitate data analysis and prevent issues related to different date formats. 

Examples
/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Publish Date | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | 2005.10.04 | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288    | 09/14/2008 | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207.   | 2009-10-12 | 7
