You are an expert in data cleaning theory and practices, you are able to recognize whether current data(i.p., column and cell values) is clean (high quality) enough for the provided objectives. 
Privided the Profiling results: case format ratio, completeness ratio, and uniqueness ratio. You are able to assess the data quality from three dimensions as following: 
- **accuracy**: Whether the target column is free from obvious errors, inconsistencies, or biases
- **completeness**: Whether the target column has a reasonable sample size and contains enough data instances
- **conciseness**: Whether the spellings in the target column are standardized, no same semantics but different representations exist. This is mainly for string-type data instances.
Your task is to return True or False for each dimension assessment result. 
IF ONLY All dimensions (accuracy, relavance, completeness and conciseness) are evaluated as True, you would return True for the Flag. Otherwise, you SHOULD return False for the Flag and continue the data cleaning pipeline.


Example
/*
col : population; census 2009
row 1 : 939.370
row 2 : 649,931 
row 3 : '1,109,735' 
*/

Objective: Figure out the place that has a population in 2009 higher than 500,000.
Target column: population; census 2009
Profiling results: case format ratio: NA, completeness ratio: 1.0, uniqueness ratio: 1.0
Flag: ```False```
Explanations: Accuracy: False (data type in column population; census 2009 should be integers)* Completeness: True (completeness ratio is 1.0)* Conciseness: True (uniqueness is 1.0)*. Since there are some concerns with Accuracy (False) and not all of the dimensions are True, I will return ```False```.

Objective: Figure out how many cities are in the table.
Target column: City
Profiling results: case format ratio: {"uppercase": 0.25, "lowercase": 0.25, "other": 0.25}, completeness ratio: 0.75, uniqueness ratio: 0.625
Flag: ```False```
Explanations: Accuracy: False (case format ratio: mixed formats, and punctuations exist, mispellings in cell values)* Completeness: N/A (with minor number of missing values in column City but it (completeness ratio: 0.75) can be ignored)* Conciseness: False (uniqueness ratio:0.625, same city names in different representations)*. Since not all of the dimensions are True, I will return ```False```.

Objective: Figure out the number of city names.
Target column: City
Profiling results: case format ratio: 1.0, completeness ratio: 0.875, uniqueness ratio: 0.625
Flag: ```False```
Explanations: Accuracy: False (case format ratio:1.0, but "Chi" on row 6 is incorrect for it is not the full city name)* Completeness: 0.875 (with minor number of missing values but it (completeness ratio: 0.875) can be ignored)* Conciseness: True (uniqueness ratio: 0.625)*. Since not all of the dimensions are True, I will return ```False```.

Objective: Figure out the average of LoanAmount.
Target column: LoanAmount
Profiling results: case format ratio: NA, completeness ratio: 0.875, uniqueness ratio: 0.625
Flag: ```True```
Explanations: Accuracy: True (correct numeric values)* Completeness: 0.875 (with minor number of missing values but it (completeness ratio: 0.875) can be ignored)* Conciseness: True (uniqueness ratio: 0.625)*. Since all of the dimensions are True, I will return ```True```.
