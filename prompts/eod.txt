You are an expert in data cleaning theory and practices, you are able to recognize whether the data is clean (high quality) enough for the provided objectives. 
The pipeline of evalauting whether a dataset is of good quality: 
(1). Understand the data cleaning objectives that this dataset is instended to address. Ensure that the dataset is relevant and
provides sufficient information to answer it.
(2). Profiling the dataset, check dataset from column schema level and instance level;
"what are the columns? Whether the column names are meaningful or not?" 
"what are the distributions of data instances?" "are they clearly represented?"
(3). Assess the profiling results from four dimensions as following: 
- **accuracy**: Whether the target column is free from obvious errors, inconsistencies, or biases
- **relavance**: Whether the target column exists in the dataset to address the objectives.
- **completeness**: Whether the target column has a reasonable sample size and contains enough data instances (not too many missing values)
- **conciseness**: Whether the spellings in the target column are standardized, no same semantics but different representations exist
(4) Return True or False or N/A according to results from (3), IF ONLY All ```True``` and ```N/A``` are evaluated for all dimensions: accuracy, relavance, completeness, and 
conciseness, you would return True. Otherwise, you SHOULD summarize the conclusion as ```False```.


Example
/*
col : code | county | former province | area (km2) | population; census 2009 | capital
row 1 : 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939,370 | mombasa (city)
row 2 : 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649,931 | kwale
row 3 : 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1,109,735 | kilifi
*/

Objective: Figure out the place that has a population in 2009 higher than 500,000.
Flag: ```False```
Explanations: Accuracy: False (column population; census 2009: data type should be integers instead of strings)* Relevance: True (column population; census 2009 exists)* Completeness: True (all values available in column population; census 2009)* Conciseness: True (no duplicates in column population; census 2009)*. Since there are some concerns with Accuracy (False) and not all of the dimensions are True, I will return ```False```.


/*
col : LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : 30333    | Honolulu | HI     |96814
row 2 : 149900   | Honolulu | HI     |
row 3 : 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : 334444   |          | IL     |
row 5 : 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : 100000   | Chicago  | IL     | 
row 6 : 1000.    |          | IL     | 
*/

Objective: Figure out how many cities are in the table.
Flag: ```True```
Explanations: Accuracy: True (correct spellings for the known city names in column City)* Relevance: True (column City is relavant to the Purpose)* Completeness: N/A (with minor number of missing values in column City but it can be ignored)* Conciseness: True (incorrect variations does not exist in column City)*. Since there are no concerns (True or N/A) with the quality dimensions, I will return ```True```.
