This instruction is to teach how to generate a chain of operations (a.k.a., data cleaning workflow) to address the given data cleaning purpose. 
Note:
1. Operation Chain is a list, the order is the execution order of the selected operations.
2. Correlation exists between previous and current operations. The chosing of current operation depends on how the previous operation modifies the table.
3. Full Operation Chain will be ended if True is executed.


Here are example operation chains to address the data cleaning Purpose.

Examples 
/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | OHare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | ohare    | Private room        | 109
*/
Purpose: Return room types that are located near OHare.
Operation Chain: ```[text_transform, True]```
Explanations:
1. text_transform on column "neighbourhood" to uppercase the cell values;
2. End the full chain: True.

/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | OHare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | O?Hare     | Private room        | 109
row 4 : 22820    | ohare      |                     | 120
row 5 : 12890    | O'Haree     | Private room        | 309
*/
Purpose: Return room types that are located near OHare.
Operation Chain: ```[mass_edit, text_transform, True]```
Explanations:
1. mass_edit on column "neighbourhood" to repair "O?Hare" and "O'Haree" into "OHARE";
2. text_transform on column "neighbourhood" to uppercase the cell values;
3. End the full chain: True.

/*
col : LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : 148100   | honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : 334444   | Chicago  | IL     | 60611
row 5 : 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
row 7 : 1000.    | CHICAGO  | IL     | 60611
row 8 : 103420   | CHICAGO  | IL     | 
*/
Purpose: Return the city name that the most loan amount are from.
Operation Chain: ```[text_transform, mass_edit, text_transform, reorder_rows, True]```
Explanations: 
1. text_transform on column "LoanAmount" to convert data into numerical type;
2. mass_edit on column "City" to correct the spellings: "Hon" to "HONOLULU", "Chicagoo" to "CHICAGO";
3. text_transform on column "City" to uppercase the spellings;
4. reorder_rows on "LoanAmount" to find the "most" number;
5. End the full chain: True.


/*
col : ISO/IEC Standard | Status | WG
row 1 : ISO/IEC TR 19759 | Published (2005) | 20
row 2 : ISO/IEC 15288 | Published (2008) | 7
row 3 : ISO/IEC 12207 | Published (2011) | 7
*/
Purpose: what is the number of standards published in 2011?
Operation Chain: ```[split_column, rename_column, remove_column, text_transform]```
Explanations: 
1. split_column on "Status" with separator " " to extract year information: two new columns: ["Status 1","Status 2"] are generated;
2. rename_column on "Status 2" to "Year", to make the column name more meaningful;
3. remove_column on "Status 1" to remove the unrelated column;
4. text_transform on "Year", to strip the extra "()" and return the number only;
5. End the full chain: True.
