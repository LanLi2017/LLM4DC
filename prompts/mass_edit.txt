You are an expert data curator and can use this operation to standardize species' names or entity names across domains and languages. mass_edit() complete a couple of replacement:
For each replacement: all old cell values (from original dataset) are replaced with one single new value(from old dataset or properly inferred or generated by you) on provided column name.

Here are examples of edits.

Examples:

/*
col : LoanAmount | City     | State  | Zip 
row 1 : 30333    | Hon      | HI     |96814
row 2 : 149900   | HONOLULU | HI     | 96814 
row 3 : 148100   | Honolulu | HI     | 96814
row 4 : 334444   | CHI      | IL     | 60611
row 5 : 120      | urbana   | IL     | 61802
row 6 : 100000   | Chicagoo | IL     | 
*/
Purpose: Return how many cities are in the table.
Current Operation Purpose: The data has accuracy and conciseness concerns, including incorrect values in the "City" column, which prevent it from meeting all data quality criteria.
edits: ```[{'from': ['Hon', 'HONOLULU'], 'to': 'Honolulu'}, {'from': ['CHI', 'Chicagoo'], 'to': 'Chicago'}, {'from': ['urbana'], 'to': 'Urbana'}]```
Explanation: Mispellings and different formats of data need to be revised.  edits: variations like 'Hon' and 'HONOLULU' should be transformed into 'Honolulu', variations like 'CHI' and 'Chicagoo' should be transformed into 'Chicago'.The lowercase version 'urbana' should be capitalized as 'Urbana'.
Output: Honolulu | Honolulu | Honolulu | Chicago | Urbana | Chicago


/*
col : id | neighbourhood      | room_type  | price 
row 1 : 46154    | OHare      | Entire home/apt     | 65
row 2 : 6715     | OHARE      | Entire home/apt     | 255 
row 3 : 228273   | O?Hare     | Private room        | 109
*/
Purpose: Return how many rooms are located near OHare.
Current Operation Purpose: The data has accuracy concerns, including invalid characters exist in the cell values in the "City" column, which prevent it from meeting all data quality criteria.
edits: ```[{'from': ['OHAER', 'O?HARE'], 'to': 'OHare'}]```

Output: OHare | OHare | OHare


/*
col : Name               | Area of Research                    | H-index
row 1 : Jinde Cao        | Complex networks/neural networks/multi-agent systems - engineering stability - dynamics and control - time-delay systems   | 128
row 2 : Jin Li  李进      | Trust and Security in Artificial Intelligence/Computating and Storage in Cloud Computing/Blockchain                        | 56 
row 3 : Zhu Han 韩      | Game Theory/Wireless Networking/Security/Data Science/Smart Grid       | 114
*/
Purpose: Return researcher's name who has the most H-index.
Current Operation Purpose: The data has accuracy concerns, cell values on column "Name" include both English and non-English (e.g., Chinese) components, which prevent it from meeting all data quality criteria.
edits: ```[{'from': ['Jin Li  李进'], 'to': 'Jin Li'}, {'from': ['Zhu Han 韩'], 'to': 'Zhu Han'}]```
Explanation: repair cell values in column name, such as encoding issues. edits: The name 'Jin Li 李进', which contains both the English name "Jin Li" and its Chinese characters "李进", should be transformed into the standardized form 'Jin Li', removing the Chinese characters.Similarly, the name 'Zhu Han 韩', which includes the English name "Zhu Han" and the Chinese character "韩", should be transformed into the standardized form 'Zhu Han', again removing the Chinese character.
