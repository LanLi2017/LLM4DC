trim: The trim function is designed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from strings in a dataset. This is particularly useful in data cleaning processes, where extraneous spaces can lead to inconsistencies, misalignments, and errors during data analysis or processing. By using the trim function, you can ensure that the data is formatted correctly for further operations. For example, 

/*
col : Book Title             | Year           | First Name
row 1 :   Against Method.    | Feyerabend,1975| P.
row 2 : Changing Order       | Collins,1985   | H.M.
row 3 :  Exceeding Our Grasp  | Stanford,2006  | P.K.
*/

Selected Operation: ```trim```
Target column: Book Title
